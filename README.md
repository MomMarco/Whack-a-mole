# Whack-a-mole
Whack a mole project on a FPGA

This project has started as a simple exam homework with the intent to put something goofy but involved with what has been seen in class on an FPGA, and now, after all the ups and downs, I can say that it works adequately. In the current iteration, the project uses th FPGA buttons and the external connections for the BDC timer, BDC score and the "mole" LEDs.
